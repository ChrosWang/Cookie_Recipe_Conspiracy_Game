I think I baked these for the first time when I came fresh out of undergrad to bring to a friend's birthday party. And I can promise you: they are <i>always</i> a success!<br>\nPreheat your oven to 325 F and prep a square pan (9X9) for nonstick. I use Parchment Paper that overhangs the sides of the pan. In a mixing bowl use a whisk (or a fork, really) to mix together your flour and baking powder. Add the unsweetened cocoa powder and mix gently. Next, in a large mixing bowl, mix together the sugar alternative (my personal is Sweet Leaf Stevia but anything goes, really) with the melted butter until well blended. For the next step we will add the dry ingredients from the first bowl to the large mixing bowl. Do this by adding half of the dry ingredients at a time, stirring gently between additions. Then add the eggs one at a time, stirring gently between additions, and then the vanilla. Use a rubber spatula to fold in your chocolate chips and some grains of salt for an extra bite. Evenly spread the batter into your pan and sprinkle the top with nuts or chaved almond flakes. Bake for 20- 25 minutes. Using the toothpick method of checking for readiness will possibly result in a false positive because of the chocolate chips. Allow your brownies to to cool prior to cutting into squares.
