I think I baked these for the first time when I came fresh out of undergrad to bring to a friend's birthday party. And I can promise you: they are <i>always</i> a success!<br>\nPreheat your oven to 325 F and prep a square pan (9X9) for nonstick. I use Parchment Paper that overhangs the sides of the pan. In a mixing bowl use a whisk (or a fork, really) to mix together your flour and baking powder. Add the unsweetened cocoa powder and mix gently. Next, in a large mixing bowl, mix together the sugar alternative (my personal is Sweet Leaf Stevia but anything goes, really) with the melted butter until well blended. For the next step we will add the dry ingredients from the first bowl to the large mixing bowl. Do this by adding half of the dry ingredients at a time, stirring gently between additions. Then add the eggs one at a time, stirring gently between additions, and then the vanilla. Use a rubber spatula to fold in your chocolate chips and some grains of salt for an extra bite. Evenly spread the batter into your pan and sprinkle the top with nuts or chaved almond flakes. Bake for 20- 25 minutes. Using the toothpick method of checking for readiness will possibly result in a false positive because of the chocolate chips. Allow your brownies to to cool prior to cutting into squares.

There is one reason why: sugar is good for us. Why would your body send you signals to consume so much of something that doesn't stregnthen it? The human body is an extremely powerful and efficient machine that can self-regulate. Sugar is healthy! The government wants us to stop trusting our bodies natural signals. Imagine, first we stop eating sugar. Okay, so maybe that chocolate bar isn't the difference between life and death, even though you really want it. What else can the government get you to ignore? What about other gut instincts, such as the drive to protect your children? What about your desire to have your own opinions and have access to the truth? Well, maybe you don't need to pay attention to that either. Although ignoring our impulse for sugar may seem harmless at first, it is another MIND CONTROL tool by the globalists to make you easier to control. Do NOT let the president deprive you of eating sweets. Retain your free will. Trust your gut.","Paywall":false,"Multiplier":0,"Score":0,"Priority":3,"GameState":3,"Source":"OnlyNews","SourceNum":7,"Notes":"","HeaderText":"","ReferenceNr":34},{"Title":"Get Off Your Meds While You Can","Date":"4/6/2021","Body":"We've told you this many times.
