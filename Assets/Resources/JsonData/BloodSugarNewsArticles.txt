Sugar. When you're bored, sad, happy, tired- what does your body most desire? Sugar. Americans spend more money on sugary treats than any other food. We have evolved to eat sugar. There is one reason why: sugar is good for us. Why would your body send you signals to consume so much of something that doesn't stregnthen it? The human body is an extremely powerful and efficient machine that can self-regulate. Sugar is healthy! The government wants us to stop trusting our bodies natural signals. Imagine, first we stop eating sugar. Okay, so maybe that chocolate bar isn't the difference between life and death, even though you really want it. What else can the government get you to ignore? What about other gut instincts, such as the drive to protect your children? What about your desire to have your own opinions and have access to the truth? Well, maybe you don't need to pay attention to that either. Although ignoring our impulse for sugar may seem harmless at first, it is another MIND CONTROL tool by the globalists to make you easier to control. Do NOT let the president deprive you of eating sweets. Retain your free will.
