[{"Title":"Is stevia really all that healthy?","Date":"4/30/2020","Body":"//[b]Is it time to say 'no' to that diet Coke?[/b]//\nI'm sure all of you know the short answer to that all-important question. YES! Always say no to the Coke, no matter how tempting it is to refresh your dehydrated body after a long session on the mat in the burning sun. But, my dear friends, I have some unfortunate news to share with you. And bear with me, because this might become a little scientific.. \n[enter]\nEven though we all [i] know [/i] that Coke is bad for us, there has always been this little voice in our heads whispering to us that even though Coke is bad, Coke Light is a lesser evil, so every now and then we succumb. We go to the bar, and order a little grey can to gulp down, and down.. What's the harm of one drink? Don't tell me you haven't done it. I for sure have! Now, as it turns out, diet Coke contains aspartame. Did you know that aspartame is actually incredibly unhealthy? It's even worse than sugar! It is a cancer-inducing chemical! Those sweeteners you put in your tea? They are little, evil mercinaries hired by your favorite brand to infiltrate your body and make you sick! I'm not going to explain the science behind it, but as your health guru I felt the responsibility to share this news with you. So. From now on, say NO to Coke, [i]especially[/i] to the Light version! \n[enter]\nIf you liked this article, why not share it with your friends?\n[enter]\nAnd as always, \nStay healthy. \nEat, Breathe, and Meditate, \nJosie","Paywall":false,"Multiplier":0,"Score":0,"Priority":1,"GameState":1,"Source":"Josie's Foodblog","Notes":"apartame\ncoke"},{"Title":"New Bloodtype Discovered - A breakthrough in human medicine? ","Date":"","Body":"//A, B...C!//[enter] Big news came in from the science department this morning. A team of researches from Gray's State University have discovered evidence for the existence of a [b] new human blood type![/b] [enter]\nUntil now, there were only 4 confirmed blood types: A, B, AB and O, the universal donor. Even though suspicions about a possible fifth type had been uttered years ago after some unresolved doping cases in the 2008 Olympics, nobody had been able to prove the theory.[enter] The team, led by renowned biologist Graham Delley, spent the past five years conducting laboratory research using brand new technology that allows for analysis of blood cells within their natural environment. That means, directly in our veins, rather than on a sample under a microscope. And the results are groundbreaking![enter] \nIt turns out that there are not merely 4 types, but [i]at least[/i] 5. The new bloodtype is aptly named bloodtype C, and its existence could prove to be the solution for many pressing questions in the field of human biology and healthcare.\n","Paywall":false,"Multiplier":0,"Score":0,"Priority":0,"GameState":2,"Key article":false,"Source":"Science Today","Notes":"Bethany McCauley\nGray State University\nGraham Delley\nBloodtypes\nA, B, AB, O, ABii\n2008\nOlympic Games"},{"Title":"WHO release: Bloodtype ABii confirmed.","Date":"","Body":"//A public statement from the secretary of public health//.

Whilst the new blood type is confirmed, there seem to be no significant implications for human medicinal practices—blood of the AB type is interchangeable with ABii blood transfusions. Correspondingly, no health benefits have been proven in relation to ABii—claims about ABii superhumans, a theory based on the belief that ABii has more effective glucose molecule transmitter properties, are therefore decidedly false.","Paywall":false,"Multiplier":0,"Score":0,"Priority":0,"GameState":3,"Key article":false,"Source":"BNN Global","Notes":"Five types\nglucose\ntransfusions\nsuperhumans"},{"Title":"Sugar field set ablaze ","Date":"","Body":"//Delley sugar field set ablaze// [enter]\n\nYesterday large flames were raging across the enormous acres of Delley owned land in Northern California.

Insiders even spoke of rumors an upcoming division, since the sugar business skyrocketed whilst aspartame sales have been dropping steeply in the last year. However, these fires seem to be the latest in a series of actions aimed at destabilizing the Delley & Sons’ sugar production, raising doubts about which group might be behind such audacious attacks. \n\n","Paywall":false,"Multiplier":0,"Score":0,"Priority":0,"GameState":4,"Key article":false,"Source":"The Chicago Herald","Notes":""}]
